sdesc: "[incr Tcl/Tk/Widgets] Object-Oriented extensions for Tcl/Tk"
ldesc: "[incr Tcl] is an object-oriented extension of the Tcl language. 
It was created to support more structured programming in Tcl. [incr Tcl]
introduces the notion of objects. Among other things, [incr Tcl] can be
used to create new widgets that look and work like the usual Tk widgets,
but are written entirely at the Tcl language level (C code is
optional)."
